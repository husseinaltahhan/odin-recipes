    <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water.</li>
        <li>Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 tablespoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley.</li>
        <li>Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
